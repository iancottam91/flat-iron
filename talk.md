(Size bug on iphone view)

Plan:

1 minute introduction of the website

Hi, in this lesson I'm going to be teaching how to develop this cricket correspondance website. And the website is single page site that displays 6 twitter profiles from prominent cricketing twitter accounts and when you click on one of the tiles displaying the account information, it'll load the tweets from that account into the right hand side of the page. And when you click a different account it'll remove the exisiting tweets and display the latest tweets from that other account. 
The site it optimised to work on a desktop and a mobile device, so if I load up developer tools and view the site on a iphone you can see that it display nice still on that device. Loading in tweets on the right, being able to scroll those and being able to scroll the twitter account profiles on the left. (50 seconds)

Talk through the javascript
One of the most interesting features of the website is the iteraction. What i mean by that is what happens behind the scenes when i click on a twitter profile panel and load the tweets into the right hand side of the screen. This is the part of the website that I'm going to start the lesson by explaining.

So to create this interaction we need to use javascript and it's going to do three things really, which are:

- load the data for the tweets
- create html based on the tweets and render that html to the page
- link it all together by attaching a click event to the tile elements on the page

To write the code for that I've create 3 javascript function, one for each part of the JavaScript code. The reason I've done that is to make the code readible and easy to understand, to give us a separate scope for each peice of funcionality so it's easier to maintain and we wont have any clashes between functions and variable in each module.

Let's look at the dataModule first:

Two functions in here:

1) fetchTweets - this is the function to retreive tweet data from the api. It expects a twitter id to be passed as a parameter and use then uses the native javascript fetch function to get the data relating to that twitter id.

For example it would make a call to the tweet/jbairstow21 endpoint and get the JSON data from there.

I want explain how fetch is working as it's quite a key concnpt to grasp. Fetch returns a promise and a promise is what JavaScript uses to do asynchronous operataions.

We've just had a questions and for those that didnt hear the question is, 'what is an asynchronous operation?'

 Asynchronous code is a part of your code that will run for an indeterminate amount of time and then allow us to do something once that code has finished running. For example, in this case getting data from the twitter api. We need to wait until we've succeeding in getting the data before trying to do something with it, so that's why we need to use asynchronous code here.

Going back to our fetchTweets function, we call fetch, and specify what to do when it has finised getting data with the 'then' function and we specify what to do with any errors with the 'catch' function.

The part we're interested in here is what we do in the `then` function, and what we're doing is saying return the data as json. Then call `extractRelevantData` with the data from the twitter api and that's our second function in the data module, which i'll talk through now. 

3.50 mins



I'll now talk through the extractRelevantData function and how we process the data that we've gathered from the twitter api.

Extract relevant data expects tweetData as a parameter and the tweet data looks like this:

SHOW DATA ON THE WEBSITE HERE

It's an array of JavaScript Objects, and each object conatins information about an individual tweet. The objects for each tweet conatin quite a lot of information and actaully much more than we need for our website. So what we want to do is process this data by extract onlying the properties of the Object that we need, which are 'created_at', 'text', and some information about the tweet user themselves which is in the user object. We're going extract this data by using a map.

Now a map is a function that's available on all Arrays in JavaScript and it's used to create a new array from an exisiting array. Hence the name map, as we're basically mapping one array onto another.
This is perfect for our twiiter data as we can just transform the array of data from the twitter api into an array of objects with just the data we need.

To use a map, we call `.map` on a array, in this case tweetData in the array we call it on, and we pass one parameter to the map, which is a function. The function that we pass to the map will be called on each individual item in the array and we should return from that function what we want the item in the new array to look like. 

So in our example here, we just return an object with the individual properties we want from each object in the tweet data. THIS IS THE OBJECT THAT WE'RE RETURNING

And the final thing we need to do in our DataModule is return the fetchTweets function, so that we can call `fetchTweets` from others parts of our code, that's written outside DataModule, for example in the RenderModule. And we only return fetchTweets, not extractRelevantData because fetchTweets is the only function we want to be able to use elsewhere. This mean that `extractRelevantData` is known as a private function because it can only be used in our DataModule.

To summarise, in our DataModule, we're getting tweet data based on a twitter handle. We're extracting relevant fields from that data and we're exposing a function that will allow us to do this elsewhere in our code.

Ok, we've justhad a question which is why do we need to return Object.freeze or in otherwords what's the purpose of the 'freeze'. 

The answer is freeze is there to ensure that no changes can be made to the object returned by dataModule anywhere else in our code. This is really important because it's prevents the functionality we've created in dataModule from being broken or overwitten by accident.

Move onto the RenderModule which is the module we'll use to create the html we need to render our view of the tweets on the right side of the page. That html is going be dynamically generated and we have two functions to do this, renderTweets and createTweetItem. 

I'm going to start by explaining `createTweetItem` which is used to create the html an individual tweet row, so for one of these tweets. Starting here and finishing here. Now you see that createTweetItem expects one parameter which is tweet and tweet is an object that we created earlier in our dataModule and it will have the format definied in the comment here. We'll use the information from the tweet object to populate our html as we're creating it.

So let have a look at how to do that. Firstly we create a list item, which will be the outermost html element, as you see SHOW THE HTML IN INSPECTOR VIEW and we use document.createElement to do that. document.createElement is a built in JavaScript function that allows to create html elements and it must be provided a tagName for the element you want to create, which in this case is `li`. It returns an Element object and one of the properties on an element object is classList and we can use that to manage that classes on the element. In this case we want to add a class called `tweet-list-item` to allow us to style this item later on and so we use the method `add` to add this class.

few more element...
img need to add a property..
tweet name add text
talk through all of the function...

QUESTION ABOUT WHY THIS IS SUCH A CONVOLUTED WAY OF DOING IT! Answer - it is, and react is an alternative
